# Question: How do you evaluate a nested ternary expression string? C# Summary

The provided C# code is a console application that evaluates a nested ternary expression string. The user is prompted to enter a ternary expression, which is then passed to the `Evaluate` method. This method uses a stack data structure to process the expression. It iterates through the expression in reverse order. If it encounters a digit, it converts the digit to an integer and pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a '?', it pops the top two values from the stack, which represent the true and false values of the ternary expression. It then checks the character before the '?' to determine whether to use the true or false value. If the character is 'T', it pushes the true value back onto the stack, otherwise it pushes the false value. The method finally returns the top value of the stack, which is the result of the evaluated expression. This result is then printed to the console. This approach effectively evaluates the nested ternary expression by breaking it down into simpler expressions and evaluating them in a last-in-first-out manner using a stack.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution follows a similar approach to the C# version. Both versions use a stack to keep track of the values of the sub-expressions and evaluate the ternary expression from right to left. 

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions:

1. In the C# version, the `Char.IsDigit` method is used to check if a character is a digit. In the Python version, there is no equivalent method used because the problem statement specifies that the ternary expression will only contain 'T', 'F', '?', ':', and digits.

2. In the C# version, the `Stack` class from the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace is used to create a stack. In the Python version, a list is used as a stack. The `append` method is used to push an element onto the stack (equivalent to the `Push` method in C#), and the `pop` method is used to remove and return the top element from the stack (equivalent to the `Pop` method in C#).

3. In the C# version, the `--i` operator is used to decrement the index `i` by one before it is used in the expression. In the Python version, the index `i` is not decremented in this way. Instead, the ':' character is popped from the stack after the first value is popped.

4. In the Python version, the `len` function is used to check if the stack is not empty. In the C# version, there is no equivalent check because the `Pop` method will throw an `InvalidOperationException` if the stack is empty.

5. In the Python version, the result is converted to a string before it is returned because the `parseTernary` method is expected to return a string. In the C# version, the `Evaluate` method returns an integer.

6. The Python version includes a check at the beginning of the `parseTernary` method to return an empty string if the input expression is `None` or empty. The C# version does not include an equivalent check.

# Java Differences

Both the C# and Java versions solve the problem in a similar way, using a stack to evaluate the ternary expression from right to left. However, there are a few differences in the language features and methods used in each version.

1. Input Reading: In C#, the Console.ReadLine() method is used to read the input from the user. In Java, a Scanner object is used to read the input.

2. Character Handling: In C#, the expression[i] syntax is used to get a character from a string, and the '0' character is subtracted from a digit character to get its numeric value. In Java, the charAt(i) method is used to get a character from a string, and the Character.getNumericValue() method is used to get the numeric value of a character.

3. Stack Type: In C#, a Stack<int> is used, meaning the stack stores integers. In Java, a Stack<Character> is used, meaning the stack stores characters. This difference is due to the way each language handles characters and their numeric values.

4. Error Handling: The Java version includes a check at the beginning of the parseTernary method to return 0 if the expression is null or empty. The C# version does not include this check.

5. Ternary Operator Evaluation: In the C# version, the ternary operator is evaluated directly in the stack push operation. In the Java version, an if-else statement is used to decide which value to push onto the stack.
